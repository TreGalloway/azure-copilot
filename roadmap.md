Notes for Claude Code
Implementation Priorities
1. Start Simple: Build MVP with basic commands before adding LLM
2. Safety First: Every destructive operation needs confirmation
3. User Experience: Prioritize helpful error messages and suggestions
4. Cost Awareness: Track and optimize LLM token usage from day 1
5. Testing: Write tests alongside features, not after
Best Practices to Follow
* Use async/await for I/O operations
* Implement proper error handling with user-friendly messages
* Log all operations for debugging and audit
* Use type hints and dataclasses for clarity
* Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines)
* Document complex logic with inline comments
Avoid These Pitfalls
* Don't call Azure APIs without validation
* Don't store credentials in code or config files
* Don't skip dry-run mode for destructive operations
* Don't ignore rate limits and API costs
* Don't build complex features before validating core value
